# CCSaveEditor

<b>INFO</b>

This is a save editor for Orteil's game Cookie Clicker which can be found [HERE](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). This is a desktop application, not a web app.

This is still a beta release, so bugs are expected. Make sure you back up your saves before trying to modify it incase something doesn't go right!

<b>REQUIREMENTS</b>

Since this application is written in C# it will only run on Windows computers with .NET Framework 4.5+

You only need the executable and the two image folders containing icons for all the upgrades and achievements.

<b>DOWNLOAD</b>

There is no need to install anything, the current beta release can be download from [HERE](https://github.com/ahoink/CCSaveEditor/releases/tag/v0.1-beta)

The download link will allow you to download a .zip folder containing the executable and the two image folders containing icons for all the upgrades and achievements.

<b>USE</b>

Hopefully the application is self-explanitory. You can edit or replace any of the icons in the images folders but don't delete or rename the images/folders otherwise the application won't work.

You can keep the program anywhere you'd like on your computer as long as the image folders stay in the same location as the executable. It will compalin if it can't find them. 

<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>

Obviously this is an open-source application. Feel free to download and modify the code in anyway. The solution file provided is for Visual Studio 2015, so it may or may not work with other versions. 

If you do use any of this code for other purposes I would appreciate credit, though of course it is not necessary. 

I'll continue work on this until I can't find any necessary changes.
